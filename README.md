# VibrationDAQ
Data Acquisition (DAQ) of the [Analog Devices ADcmXL3021](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adcmxl3021.html#product-overview) vibration sensor. The VibrationDAQ was developed as part of an internship at [Wingtra](https://wingtra.com/) by [Jonas Lauener](https://www.jolau.ch/).

### Pinout Raspberry Pi

|       | pin | pin |       |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| RST 1 | 13  |     |       |
| BSY 1 | 15  | 16  | RST 2 |
| 3V3   | 17  | 18  | BSY 2 |
| MOSI  | 19  | 20  | EMPTY |
| MISO  | 21  | 22  | SYNC  |
| SCLK  | 23  | 24  | CE 1  |
| GND   | 25  | 26  | CE 2  |

The vibration sensor only works on the main SPI pins (SPI0) of the Raspberry Pi - the other SPI ports don't support SPI mode 3.

### Custom adapter board
The pins of the ADcmXL3021 vibration sensor can be accessed by using a custom adapter board. The PCB was created by using the software KiCad: [KiCad project files](ADcmXL3021_adapter/ADcmXL3021_adapter.pro)\

## Installation
_In case you want to setup your own VibrationDAQ on a Raspberry Pi:_
1. Install yaml-cpp (as described below)
2. Clone this repo.
3. `cd VibrationDAQ`
4. `mkdir build & cd build`
5. `cmake ..`
6. `sudo make install`

Make sure that you have [enabled SPI](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/08/enabling-the-spi-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/).

You can use it now with `vibration_daq_app [full path to config.yaml]`.

#### Installation of yaml-cpp
1. `wget https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/archive/yaml-cpp-0.6.3.tar.gz`
2. `tar -xvf yaml-cpp-0.6.3.tar.gz`
3. `cd yaml-cpp-yaml-cpp-0.6.3/`
4. `mkdir build`
5. `cd build`
6. `cmake .. -DYAML_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
7. `sudo make install`

### Enable/Disable auto-start
1. Edit config.yaml path in vibration_daq.service file to own needs 
2. `sudo systemctl enable [full path to vibration_daq.service file]`    
    This automatically links the service and enables it. Replace `enable` with `disable` to disable service.

## Dependencies
Many thanks to the authors of the following libraries:
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
- [loguru](https://github.com/emilk/loguru)
- [c-periphery](https://github.com/vsergeev/c-periphery)
- [date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date)

## Usage
### Workflow
1. Connect to the Raspberry Pi and adapt the `~/Documents/config.yaml` to your requirements. Make sure that auto-start is enabled. If it's the first time you use it, test it by running it manually: `vibration_daq_app [full path to config.yaml]`
2. Mount the vibration sensor with the double sided tape [3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 950](https://www.digikey.ch/product-detail/en/3m-tc/3-4-5-950/3M9743-ND/2649288). This shouldn't distort the vibration too much.
3. Do your measurement.
4. Download the collected data over SFTP. I recommend to also download the used config file.
6. Open a vibration CSV file in Google Sheets. 
    - For FFT measurement: 
        - Hide the first two data points as these have usually very high magnitude and don't give meaningful information
        - Plot the data using a column chart.  

### Status led
If the status led is enabled in config, it will glow when running:
- Constant glow: data acquisition is running normally
- Blink: measurement completed, saving data to a new csv file

### Decimation Filter
Setting the right `decimation_factor` is crucial for getting meaningful data. Choose it according to the maximum vibration frequency you're expecting.
Of course, the decimation factor also affects the predefined FIR filters i.e. with a FACTOR_64, the LOW_PASS_10kHz is actually a 156 Hz low pass filter.  
 
| **decimation_factor** | **Effective Sample Rate, fS (SPS)** | **Effective FFT Bin Size, f_MIN (Hz)** | **Effective Maximum FFT Frequency, f_MAX (Hz)** |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| FACTOR_1          | 220000                          | 53.71094                           | 110000                                      |

| FACTOR_4          | 55000                           | 13.42773                           | 27500                                       |

| FACTOR_16         | 13750                           | 3.356934                           | 6875                                        |
| FACTOR_32         | 6875                            | 1.678467                           | 3437.5                                      |

| FACTOR_128        | 1718.75                         | 0.419617                           | 859.375                                     |

### Spectral average count
The `spectral_avg_count` determines the number of FFT records that the ADcmXL3021 averages when generating the final FFT result. Up to 255 records. Good for getting FFT measurements over longer time periods.

### Calculate measurement duration
#### FFT
4096 samples / (220'000 sample rate / `decimation_factor`) * `spectral_avg_count` = record time [s]

##### Example with FACTOR_64 and 255 spectral averages:
4096 samples / (220000 sample rate / 64) * 255 = 303.84 seconds = 5.06 minutes

#### MTC
4096 samples / (220'000 sample rate / `decimation_factor`) = record time [s]
